NEWS for log-go v0.13.0:

	This release updates the log server to implement the v1 sigsum
	protocols, see
	https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/log.md.

	Upgrading existing log services is automatic, see below for
	the implications of upgrading. However, downgrading is *NOT*
	tested or supported (downgrading would require replacing the
	signed-tree-head file, from backup if possible, otherwise
	creating a new one using sigsum-mktree).

	New features:

	* Implemented new witness protocol, where the log queries
	  witnesses for cosignatures. See
	  https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/witness.md.
	  for the specification. Witnesses to use are configured using
	  a sigsum policy file.

	Incompatible changes:

	* Tree head serialization used for signatures and cosignatures
	  changed to use a a checkpoint-compatible text serialization.

	* Leaf signatures as well as submit token signatures changed
	  to no longer use SSH signature format.

	* A cosignature version is added to cosignature lines in the
	  response to get-tree-head.

	Upgrading:

	* Existing logs can be upgraded; for the transition, the old
	  way of signing tree heads is recognized when loading the log
	  server's signed-tree-head file.

	* An upgraded log will publish tree heads signed accordning to
	  the v1 protocol, and accept new leaves signed according to
	  the v1 protocol.

	* Old leaves submitted according to the v0 protocol obviously
	  stay in the tree, but they will appear invalid to anyone who
	  has the submitter's public key and attempts to verify the
	  leaf signature according to the v1 specification.

	* Old sigsum proofs can still be verified using old tools
	  (since verification is purely offline, the log server is not
	  involved at all). However, attempting to create a new proof
	  for an old leaf will fail.

NEWS for log-go v0.9.0

	First advertised release, implementing the v0 sigsum protocol.
	Recent user-visible changes:

	* Support for the initial sigsum cosignature mechanism, with witnesses
	  polling the log, has been removed. A new mechanism, based on the log
	  querying witnesses, will be added in a later release.

	* The Trillian tree id to use is now read from a file, with
	  contents of the form "tree-id=...". The name of the file is
	  specified using the configuration option
	  trillian-tree-id-file. The old option tree-id, for setting
	  the numerical id directly, is deleted.

	* Command line options now follow GNU style, with double dash
	  for long options, and naming of command line flags and
	  corresponding configuration file options have been
	  overhauled.
