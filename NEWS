NEWS for log-go v0.9.0

	First advertised release, implementing v0 sigsum protocols.
	Recent user-visible changes:

	* The initial sigsum cosignature mechanism (with witnesses
	  polling the log) is deleted. New mechanism, based on the log
	  querying witnesses, to be added in a later release.

	* Command line options now follow GNU style, with double dash
	  for long options. Naming of command line flags and
	  corresponding config file options has been overhauled. E.g,
	  --key-file to specify the signing key to use.
