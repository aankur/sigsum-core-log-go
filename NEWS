NEWS for log-go v0.9.0

	First advertised release, implementing the v0 sigsum protocol.
	Recent user-visible changes:

	* Support for the initial sigsum cosignature mechanism, with witnesses
	  polling the log, has been removed. A new mechanism, based on the log
	  querying witnesses, will be added in a later release.

	* The Trillian tree id to use is now read from a file, with
	  contents of the form "tree-id=...". The name of the file is
	  specified using the configuration option
	  trillian-tree-id-file. The old option tree-id, for setting
	  the numerical id directly, is deleted.

	* Command line options now follow GNU style, with double dash
	  for long options, and naming of command line flags and
	  corresponding configuration file options have been
	  overhauled.
